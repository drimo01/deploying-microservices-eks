# Project 2: Deploying Microservices on Amazon EKS

This project demonstrates the deployment of containerized microservices on **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**, showcasing how to build scalable, manageable, and secure cloud-native applications using Kubernetes and AWS services.

---

## �� Project Overview

The goal of this project is to set up an Amazon EKS cluster and deploy microservices using Kubernetes. The deployment leverages containerization, Helm charts, and Kubernetes native features such as autoscaling and load balancing to create a production-ready environment.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Amazon EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- **Kubernetes**
- **Docker**
- **Helm** (Kubernetes package manager)
- **AWS CLI**
- **eksctl**
- **kubectl**
- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**

---

## 📋 Project Steps

1. **Create EKS Cluster**  
   Use `eksctl` to provision a managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

2. **Containerize Microservices**  
   Build Docker images for your microservices and push them to Amazon ECR.

3. **Deploy Microservices**  
   Use Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts to deploy microservices on EKS.

4. **Expose Services**  
   Configure Kubernetes Services and Ingress to expose your applications externally.

5. **Autoscaling**  
   Set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale microservices based on demand.

6. **Monitoring & Logging**  
   Integrate monitoring tools to track cluster health and application performance.

Once deployed, microservices can be accessed via the external load balancer URL generated by AWS.
